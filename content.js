/* ============================================================
   TECHNICAL BINDER — CONTENT
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the only file most people need to touch.
   It is plain JSON wrapped in one line of JavaScript so the site
   works when you just double-click index.html (no web server).

   Rules:
     - Every section needs: id, category, title, thesis
     - "thesis" is the one-line summary shown under the title
     - Set "print: false" on a section to leave it out of print.html
       (e.g. a video-only section with nothing worth putting on paper)
     - "features" is an optional bullet list; leave [] to hide it
     - "media" is a list of blocks, rendered top to bottom. Every
       block type below can take an optional "label" — it prints
       as a small heading above the block (e.g. "Prototyping").
     - In any text you can use **bold** and `code`
